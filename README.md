### Project Description
RoastBot is a playful and interactive web app designed to humorously roast users based on their inputs. It features a vibrant animated background with shifting gradients, floating emoji effects, and a dynamic particle canvas to create an engaging atmosphere. Users can type messages or chat directly with RoastBot, which responds with witty, context-aware insults and jokes in Malayalam and English. The interface includes multiple buttons to trigger different roast modes, change themes, toggle voice responses, and even a mischievous ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Click Me‚Äù button that playfully disables input temporarily. The chat supports text and animated GIF replies, and users can download the conversation logs for fun. Overall, it‚Äôs a fun, lighthearted project that combines creative design and simple AI-style interactions to entertain users.



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Here‚Äôs a summary of the problems you might have in your code and how to solve them:

Rude Button Moving Offscreen or Overlapping
Solution: Limit its random position so it stays fully visible inside the viewport, e.g., subtract button width/height from max left/top values.

Dark Mode Overwrites User Theme Changes
Solution: Store the current background and colors before toggling dark mode, then restore them when toggling back, so user changes aren‚Äôt lost.

Disabling Inputs for 10 Seconds Might Frustrate Users
Solution: Show a clear countdown or warning before disabling, or make the disable time shorter. Alternatively, disable only specific inputs instead of all.

Speech Synthesis Overlaps
Solution: Cancel ongoing speech synthesis before speaking new text with speechSynthesis.cancel().

Input Validation and Accessibility
Solution: Add basic sanitization and aria attributes. Hide decorative emojis from screen readers using aria-hidden="true".
